# ML-Telecom-customer-Churn-analysis-and-Churn-Prediction


In order to forecast customer attrition, the project uses a variety of machine learning models, including logistic regression, random forest, SVMs, and neural networks.
Applied methods such as binning tenure data and addressing missing values (e.g., Total Charges with 11 missing rows) to perform comprehensive data analysis on a dataset consisting of 7043 observations and 21 columns.
Outperformed other models such as logistic regression (AUC: 0.8258, accuracy: 73.49%, F1: 0.6036) and SVM radial model (AUC: 0.8261, accuracy: 77.40%, F1: 0.4770) using the ANN model, displaying an astounding 75.12% accuracy, an AUC of 0.8259, and an astounding F1 score of 0.6111.
